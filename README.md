# Workflow Studio

**Automate anything on your computer — no coding required.**

Workflow Studio is a desktop app that lets you build powerful automations by combining simple actions like mouse clicks, keyboard presses, and screen detection. Whether you're automating repetitive tasks in a game, streamlining your daily workflow, or just saving time on boring stuff — Workflow Studio makes it easy.

## What Can It Do?

- **Click, type, and move the mouse** — Automate any sequence of mouse and keyboard actions
- **Detect images and pixels on screen** — Wait for something to appear, then act on it
- **Loop and repeat** — Run actions multiple times with natural timing
- **Conditional logic** — Make smart decisions based on what's happening on screen
- **Global hotkeys** — Trigger any workflow instantly from any app with a keyboard shortcut
- **Human-like behavior** — Built-in randomization, mouse curves, and natural typing so your automation looks real

## Getting Started

1. **Download** the latest installer from [Releases](https://github.com/grezxune/workflow-studio/releases)
2. **Install** and launch Workflow Studio
3. **Create a workflow** — Click "New Workflow" and start adding actions
4. **Run it** — Hit the play button and watch it go

That's it. No scripts, no config files, no terminal commands.

## Building Workflows

Every workflow is a list of actions that run in order. You can mix and match:

| Action | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **Mouse Move** | Moves the cursor to a spot on screen with natural-looking motion |
| **Mouse Click** | Clicks (left, right, double) at any position |
| **Keyboard** | Types text, presses keys, or holds key combos |
| **Wait** | Pauses for a set time or waits until something appears on screen |
| **Loop** | Repeats a group of actions a set number of times |
| **Conditional** | Checks a condition (like "is this image on screen?") and branches |
| **Find Image** | Searches the screen for a specific image |
| **Find Pixel** | Looks for a specific color at a location |

Drag and drop to reorder. Nest actions inside loops and conditionals. Everything auto-saves as you work.

## Global Hotkeys

Set up keyboard shortcuts that work **from any application** on your computer.

1. Go to the **Hotkeys** tab
2. Pick a workflow and record a key combo (like `Ctrl+Shift+1`)
3. Press that combo from anywhere — your workflow starts instantly

Perfect for triggering automations without switching windows.

## Safety First

Workflow Studio is built with safety in mind:

- **Emergency Stop (F7)** — Instantly kills any running automation, no matter what app you're in
- **Pause / Resume (F6)** — Pause a running workflow and pick up right where you left off
- Both hotkeys are global and work from any application
- Both are fully customizable in Settings

## Looks Like a Real Person

Unlike basic macro tools, Workflow Studio makes your automation look natural:

- **Wind Mouse** — Cursor follows realistic curved paths instead of teleporting
- **Click Jitter** — Tiny random offsets so you never click the exact same pixel twice
- **Overshoot** — Occasionally moves past the target and corrects, like a real hand
- **Typing Variation** — Random delays between keystrokes for natural-looking typing
- **Randomized Timing** — Every wait and delay has a configurable range, not a fixed number

## Auto-Updates

Workflow Studio checks for updates automatically. When a new version is available, you'll see a banner at the top of the app. You can also check manually in **Settings → About & Updates**.

## System Requirements

- **Windows 10 or later**
- No additional software needed — everything is included in the installer
